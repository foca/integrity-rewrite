Some thoughts/goals regarding integrity:
========================================

* It should "just run". As any good sinatra citizen `ruby app.rb` or `shotgun
  config.ru` should work for development purposes.

* Installing on a server should not require anything else than:
  - A command to install
  - (Optionally) Edit one config file
  - Run the app
  - Edit your front balancer server (nginx, apache) to point to the app

* Linked to the above, integrity should depend on as few libraries as possible.
  This eases up support as it's harder to run into dependency problems.

* Nothing should be pushed to master without at least one other developer 
  reviewing the changes before. master should always be stable.

* Everything that could change regularly must be done via the web UI. Touching
  the config file should be left for one time configs (adding plugins, etc).

* Extending the application with new features *by users* should be trivial. 
  Extension points should be present at any point of the workflow.

* Model attributes should never be directly accessed from the views, helper
  methods to access them should always be used. This allows extension authors
  to override a helper (potentially calling super if they need) instead of
  monkeypatching integrity's classes.
 
* Fully Documented. No methods should be added without API documentation.
